# Deep Learning in R Lab

## Setup instructions

Please read the instructions in this document:

[running-docker-containers.md](running-docker-containers.md)

and **complete any instructions marked as "[SETUP before 5/23]"** before the structured discussion on 5/23 so that we can spend most of class time training neural networks (instead of doing setup). If you are stuck on any part of the instructions, don't hesitate to post on the [CLE forum](https://courses.ucsf.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=546441) -- if you are stuck, likely someone else in class is stuck too! 

UPDATE ON 5/24: Please **complete any instructions marked as "[SETUP before 5/30]"** before the structured discussion on 5/30. As before, don't hesitate to post on the CLE forum if you are stuck.

## Lab

We are going to learn how to train two neural networks to classify good old MNIST handwritten digits dataset. We will be using these R scripts:

- [mnist_elasticnet_logistic_regression.R](mnist_elasticnet_logistic_regression.R): Penalized logistic regression on MNIST

- [mnist_fc.R](mnist_fc.R): Fully-connected neural network on MNIST

- [mnist_conv.R](mnist_conv.R): Convolutional neural network on MNIST
